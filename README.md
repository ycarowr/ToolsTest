Hello, Im keeping in this repository for two different reasons:

1. It's a bunch of tools and patterns that I found useful to create my own games;
2. I also use this repository to improve my own personal coding and communication skills, from clean code to a specific implementation of an algorithm or design pattern. 

Most of the stuff here you can also find wandering around the internet, on youtube, unity forum, stackoverflow, unity3d.college, java-design-patterns.com, or any other code information hub. I also very often pick some idea and make my own different implementation. However, I'll try to include the sources when I have it. Feel free to use everything. Thanks.
