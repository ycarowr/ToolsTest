It works reading data stored in scriptable objects:
1. Text Sequence: its basically an array of texts; 
2. Text Piece: its a text, plus a custom event fired when the next button is pressed.

Text Piece sample:

Todo: 
1. Add event when the a text piece finishes to write.
2. Make a localization system to load the texts from jsons instead reading the raw string.
3. ...
