Hello, Im keeping in this repository for two different reasons:

1. It's a test of the following submodule of tools and patterns that I found useful to create my own games;
2. I also use this repository to improve my own personal coding skills, from clean code to a specific implementation of an algorithm or design pattern. 

[Tools Repository](https://github.com/ycarowr/Tools)

Most of the stuff here you can also find wandering around the internet, on youtube, unity forums, stackoverflow, unity3d.college, java-design-patterns.com, or any other code information hub. I'll try to include the sources when I have it. Feel free to use everything. Thanks.
