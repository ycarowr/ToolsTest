# Im keeping in this repository for two different reasons:

# 1. It's a bunch of tools and patterns that I found useful to create my own games;
# 2. I also use this repository to improve my own personal coding skills, from clean code to a specific implementation of an algorithm. 
# Most of the stuff here you can also find on youtube or wandering around the internet on unity forum, stackoverflow, unity3d.college, java-design-patterns.com etc.
